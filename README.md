# Clarity License Deactivator
This package deactivates users who have not logged in to Clarity PPM for over 90 days.

## Business Reason
It helps you saving costs, since deactivated users do not consume licenses on Clarity.

## Important
It works for On Premise customers only, even if you use LDAP, SSO or Clarity user directory! It does not work for SaaS customers, since Broadcom On Demand Portal has its own user directory system.

## How does it work?
It implements a process called Deactivate Users which you can both manually run through the Organizer feature or create a recurring job to automatically trigger the process. Do not forget to activate this process after installing this package.
